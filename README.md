# Answering-Business-Questions-with-SQL

For this project I used the SQLite module within Python to answer business questions about a record store. Below is a sample of some of my code, the full code can be seen in a Jupyter Notebook that is linked in the repository. I defined functions in order to run queries and commands and wrote several advanced SQL queries, including subqueries, CTEs and multiple joins.
